The code allows user to calculate the average of any student or any class within the school for any subject
given that the student, the subject and the class exist in the corresponding lists (cf the code)

Some code rules : 
  The average is rounded to 2 decimals after comma
  30 students and 10 subjects maximum for each class

The code was created during my training program with HN Institut (France)
